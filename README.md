# Graphite Wrapped

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-rubric-app`](https://github.com/RubricLab/create-rubric-app).

## Getting Started

```sh
bun i
bun dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start modifying the UI by editing [src/app/page.tsx](./src/app/page.tsx). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

A partnership between [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/) x [Rubric Labs](https://rubriclabs.com/).
